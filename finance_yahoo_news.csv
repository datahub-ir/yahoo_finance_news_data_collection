"* Reuters Live Markets blog:By Elizabeth HowcroftLONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - World shares traded near record highs on Monday, as markets were generally upbeat about the prospects for a global economic recovery from COVID-19, ahead of a busy week for earnings.Europe's STOXX 600 reached a record high and was up 0.2% at 0736 GMT. Asian shares hit one-month highs overnight.MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day, having come close to but not surpassed Friday's record high. MSCI's main European Index was up 0.1%.Matthias Scheiber, global head of portfolio management at Wells Fargo Asset Management cited low interest rates, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the fiscal stimulus package in the United States as reasons for his bullish stance on equities.""Risk is coming down, volatility is coming down … we see the slow reopening of global economies, the rollout of the vaccine and the huge catch-up in demand so from that perspective it should be positive for economic growth.""""We had a strong rally in cyclical and value stocks since the start of this year - we would like to see confirmation in the earnings.""Earnings from IBM and Coca-Cola are due later in the session. Netflix reports on Tuesday. Later in the week, American Airlines and Southwest will be the first major post-COVID cyclicals to post results.The European Central Bank meeting on Thursday will also be in focus this week. ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week that the euro zone economy is still standing on the ""two crutches"" of monetary and fiscal stimulus and these cannot be taken away until it makes a full recovery.Euro zone government bond yields were lower, with the benchmark German 10-year yield down one basis point at -0.27% .The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield, which dropped as low as 1.528% last Thursday, was at 1.5606%.The U.S. economy is set to take off this year as more Americans get COVID-19 vaccinations and become comfortable engaging in a wider range of activities, but any accompanying spike in inflation is likely to be temporary, the Federal Reserve's newest board member said on Friday.Story continuesIn currency markets, the dollar index was down 0.4% at its lowest levels in more than a month, at 91.259, having weakened since its recent peak of 93.439 at the end of March.Dollar-yen was also down 0.5%, changing hands at 108.250 .The euro was up 0.3% versus the dollar at $1.20165 .""We have been highlighting over the past two months that USD could bottom out, in contrast to consensus, and believed that this would be a tactical problem for EM and for certain commodity trades,"" wrote JP Morgan's head of global and European equity strategy, Mislav Matejka, in a note to clients. ""We think the risk of a firmer USD, through rising US-Europe interest rate differential, is not finished.""Matejka also said that, although there is the technical potential for a correction in equities, he would not cut stocks exposure on the six- to nine-month horizon.""We think that it is more likely that we will be raising our year-end targets, rather than reducing them, as we move through the summer,"" he said.Likewise, Wells Fargo Asset Management's Matthias Scheiber said ""We believe we are in the 'buy the dip' environment at this moment given that both fiscal and monetary policy are very supportive, so if we would see a correction … we would probably increase the equity position.”Bitcoin was up nearly 2% at around $57,400, nursing losses from Sunday, when it plunged as much as 14% to $51,541.Oil prices fell as rising COVID-19 infections in India prompted concern than stronger measures to contain the pandemic would hurt economic activity.(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft, editing by Larry King)",GLOBAL MARKETS-European shares hit highs as markets upbeat about recovery prospects,2021-04-19 12:47:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-european-shares-hit-084751785.html

"(Bloomberg) -- Juventus Football Club S.p.A. shares jumped the most in a year after the Italian soccer club joined a group of the game’s wealthiest teams in announcing plans for a new “super league” that could transform revenue streams at the top level of the sport.Juventus stock rose as much as 10% to 85 euro cents in early Milan trading, with Juve Chairman Andrea Agnelli set to be a vice chair of the breakaway group. Other members include Manchester United Plc, whose shares rose 3.9% in early U.S. premarket trading on thin volume.Establishing a new elite tournament in Europe would effectively end the UEFA Champions League’s decades-long reign as the world’s premier club contest, and revolutionize the sport’s structure. Under the plan, 15 founding teams would share an upfront payment of 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion).“The financial incentive for the clubs is plain to see, with a multi-billion dollar package at the heart of the scheme, albeit it would forever break the integrity of the club game,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in emailed comments.Even shares of teams not part of the breakaway group were boosted by news of the plan. Germany’s Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co KGaA rose as much as 7%, while AFC Ajax N.V. of the Netherlands gained 0.6%.BT Group Plc, which currently holds Champions League broadcasting rights in the U.K., advanced 0.1%.The news follows a year in which soccer clubs’ incomes were slashed by the pandemic preventing fans from entering stadiums.

"(Bloomberg) -- European stocks rose and U.S. equity futures swung between red and green as momentum in corporate earnings and the global economic recovery buoyed investor sentiment. The dollar slid.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced to a fresh record following a seventh straight week of gains.

Blue-chip companies reporting later on Monday include The Coca-Cola Company, IBM and United Airlines Holdings Inc.Chinese stocks outperformed amid easing concerns about the health of state enterprise China Huarong Asset Management Co., a distressed-debt manager. China’s financial regulator on Friday said Huarong had ample liquidity, the first official comments since the company missed a deadline to report earnings. Ebbing fears of contagion drove a rally in Huarong bonds.Robust economic data from China and the U.S. last week helped push the MSCI All-Country World Index to another record despite concerns surrounding the spread of Covid-19 variants. New infections in the past week surpassed 5.2 million, the most since the pandemic began.The risk of another destabilizing increase in borrowing costs has also subsided, as bond yields have pulled back from recent highs. This week traders will look for further confirmation of the private sector’s recovery from the pandemic as the earnings season gathers pace.“Our current view is that with short-term interest rates set to remain low for the medium term and our expectation that earnings will continue to increase, it is unlikely that the increase in long-term interest rates will trigger an equity market fall,” Russel Chesler, head of investments and capital markets at VanEck Australia, said in a note.Elsewhere, Bitcoin pared losses after tumbling the most since February over the weekend.Here are some key events to watch this week:Apple’s first product unveiling of the year on Tuesday.Reserve Bank of Australia releases minutes of its policy meeting on Tuesday.EIA crude oil inventory report on Wednesday.European Central Bank rate decision and President Christine Lagarde briefing on Thursday.U.S. releases manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes Friday.Story continuesThese are some of the main moves in financial markets:StocksFutures on the S&P 500 Index were little changed at 9:14 a.m. London time.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.2%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index increased 0.1%.CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dipped 0.3%.The euro gained 0.3% to $1.2019.The British pound rose 0.3% to $1.3877.The onshore yuan strengthened 0.1% to 6.512 per dollar.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.6% to 108.17 per dollar.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries fell two basis points to 1.56%.The yield on two-year Treasuries dipped less than one basis point to 0.16%.Germany’s 10-year yield was unchanged at -0.26%.Britain’s 10-year yield dipped less than one basis point to 0.762%.Japan’s 10-year yield fell one basis point to 0.087%.CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude increased 0.1% to $63.17 a barrel.Brent crude was little changed at $66.74 a barrel.Gold strengthened 0.5% to $1,785.45 an ounce.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Europe Stocks Climb as Futures Drift; Dollar Drops: Markets Wrap,2021-04-19 10:16:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-start-week-highs-dollar-212408451.html
"* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2BqrBy Dhara RanasingheLONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields were broadly steady on Monday, with markets largely on hold ahead of this week's European Central Bank meeting.New supply, estimated at over 30 billion euros ($36 billion) this year and above the average for the year so far according to Commerzbank, could put some upward pressure on yields.However, significant moves were likely to be limited ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting.The ECB has stepped up the pace of bond buying in its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme since the March meeting to contain a rise in borrowing costs that could derail the recovery.Latest weekly bond buying data are released later on Monday. Bond markets are watching what the ECB says and does closely amid some of disagreement among policymakers over the future pace of bond purchases especially once recovery takes hold.""(ECB chief Christine) Lagarde should try and steer clear of the debate on the future of PEPP, to avoid showcasing divisions on the governing council,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING.""Too many displays of optimism are equally unadvisable, but the outlook has improved in the euro zone, if tentatively.”In early trade, most 10-year bond yields across the single-currency bloc were little changed on the day.Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was steady at around -0.27%, seven basis points below almost one-year highs hit in late February but up 13 bps from six-week lows hit in March.U.S. Treasury yields were a touch lower and further falls there were expected to push down euro area debt yields.There was some focus on the race to be Germany's next leader.The Green party is expected on Monday to present its candidate for chancellor ahead of September's federal election.""This is an important one to look out for, as the CDU/CSU’s slump in the polls has put them only a few points ahead of the second-place Greens, so it’s no longer implausible that the next German chancellor could come from the Greens,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note, referring to the ruling Christian Democrats and the CSU sister party.With CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel stepping down after the election, pressure is mounting on the CDU/CSU bloc to agree on a candidate as its ratings wallow near a one-year low, hurt by the government's handling of COVID-19.

"By Brenna Hughes NeghaiwiZURICH (Reuters) - While Wall Street rivals feast off a boom in trading and deals, Credit Suisse is stuck in limbo.The collapse of Archegos, a U.S. investment fund, has left the Swiss bank nursing an anticipated pretax loss of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter. That, plus the demise of another client, Greensill Capital, have triggered internal and external probes and the ousting of a swathe of executives.Investors seeking clarity on what next for Credit Suisse's investment bank, at the heart of the Archegos debacle, and its asset management division, which ran $10 billion in funds linked to Greensill, are unlikely to get final answers on Thursday, when the bank publishes first quarter results.Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein has said that Credit Suisse's incoming chairman, former Lloyd's boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, will likely undertake a strategic review of the bank when he joins next month.Buoyed by a boom in capital raising and deals, Credit Suisse was on the cusp of a bumper start to 2021 before a 4.4 billion franc ($4.77 billion) loss from Archegos.Credit Suisse has emerged as the bank hardest-hit from its exposure to Archegos, which collapsed when it couldn't meet margin calls. Analysts at JPMorgan say Credit Suisse may face another loss of around $400 million this quarter from unwinding Archegos-linked stocks.Credit Suisse has declined to comment on the estimate.Stripping out the 4.4 billion franc charge, the implied underlying pre-tax profit of around 3.5 billion francs would have represented the bank's best quarter operationally in at least a decade.U.S. rivals, some of which were quicker to exit trading positions as Archegos collapsed, produced forecast-beating profits. Goldman Sachs' first quarter net income rose nearly sixfold. Morgan Stanley reported a 150% jump in profit despite disclosing an almost $1 billion loss from Archegos.Credit Suisse shareholders, meanwhile, are facing a slashed dividend, halted share buybacks and a share price down 15% so far this year.Story continuesThe bank has said further buybacks will have to wait until it returns capital to target ratios and is able to restore its dividend.The Financial Times reported last week the group had slashed costs through bonus cuts and other one-off items.While the move helped bolster capital it could hurt the bank's franchise.Widespread departures are a real worry for management, one source familiar with the bank's operations told Reuters.""You have many areas which likely performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, and bankers expect to be paid for exceptional performance. So this becomes a major issue for staff retention,"" Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said. ""The options are limited: either they face the risk of losing staff, or they have to make up for this gap with higher accruals in the remaining three quarters.""Credit Suisse declined to comment.It had previously aimed for a common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 12.5% for the first half of 2021, but now expects a first quarter ratio of at least 12%.""The big question Credit Suisse will have to discuss this week is: what will FINMA impose in terms of stricter capital requirements, as they did in 2011 with UBS?"" Venditti said.FINMA, Switzerland's financial supervisor, declined comment.In 2011, when rival UBS suffered a $2.3 billion loss over rogue trades executed by a London-based employee, FINMA imposed capital restrictions and requested UBS bulk up on capital to back its operational risks.Venditti said he expected to see an RWA inflation at Credit Suisse from the second quarter.That would give the bank less room for manoeuvre in its handling of disgruntled fund investors seeking payout after the Greensill debacle, he said, while also posing a potential drag to future earnings during a period of record deal-making and roaring trading.Credit Suisse still faces questions over how it will address $2.3 billion at-risk funds that it is seeking to return to investors following the collapse of its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds.It has, so far, distributed $4.8 billion to clients.($1 = 0.9234 Swiss francs)(Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; additional reporting by Matt Scuffham and Oliver Hirt: editing by Carmel Crimmins)",Credit Suisse serves investors thin gruel as Wall Street feasts on deals,2021-04-19 10:06:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-serves-investors-thin-070658393.html
"(Bloomberg) -- Japan won praise during the pandemic for staying open while other developed economies locked down -- helping lift stocks to three-decade highs. But as the country now struggles with its inoculation program, a case of vaccine envy is breaking out.The Topix is down 2.8% in the past month, compared with gains of 7% in the S&P 500 Index and 4.6% by the FTSE 100 in London, where photos of revelers at re-opened pubs this week contrast with reports from Tokyo, where hours at bars and restaurants have been shortened as virus cases surge.“Japanese indexes are starting to fall behind. Foreign investors are looking at vaccination rates as an investment decision,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a senior market analyst at Matsui Securities Co. “Markets are at their wits end right now with the vaccination rate slower in Japan.”Talks on a new supply of vaccine between Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla failed to immediately lift spirits in Tokyo markets, as the governors of both Tokyo and Osaka opened the door to declaring another virus emergency.Suga told reporters on Monday that Pfizer had agreed to hold talks on supplying more of the vaccine, and that he expected to have sufficient supplies for the entire country by the end of September. However, he didn’t give further clarity on the timeline or how many doses might be secured. Japan’s vaccine czar Taro Kono said Sunday that a deal had been effectively reached with Pfizer.“The news on the vaccines is outstanding and should help the market regain some of it recent global underperformance in the last few weeks,” John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co., said.The first shipments of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine, which could be approved for use in Japan as early as next month, are also set to arrive this week, according to a report by the Jiji news agency.Olympic FocusJapan has entered a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with fewer than 100 days before the scheduled opening of the Olympic Games. A senior official in Japan’s ruling party indicated last week that canceling the event was an option, though he later clarified his remarks.Story continuesIn Tokyo’s financial circles, some envy peers abroad who have already been vaccinated. Hong Kong on Thursday expanded eligibility to all people over the age of 16. Japan has yet to set out a schedule for groups beyond those over the age of 65, although officials have said they expect the rates to increase in May.“If the inoculation rate for Japan remains so overwhelmingly low, it’s inevitable that compared to other countries, the recovery of the economy will be significantly delayed,” Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, wrote in a report.The country plans to distribute enough vaccine to cover both doses for people 65 years and older by the end of June, though the timeframe for actual administration of the shots hasn’t been finalized.Less UrgencyJapan started inoculations of the elderly one week ago, with only about 7,000 of the 36 million over-65s administered to in the first four days. Nearly 2 million doses have also been given to medical workers.A combination of factors has dragged the rollout, including a requirement for local trials, a lack of domestic development and production capacity that has made Japan dependent on imports, and a public long-skeptical of vaccines.Also, with around 500,000 reported cases to date -- compared to 31 million in the U.S. and 5.2 million in France -- Japan hasn’t felt as much urgency as many nations in the West. Indeed, even during the most recent state of emergency, businesses both large and small mostly stayed open.“Globally, Japan is still an A-student in terms of how little economic activity declined,” said Hiroshi Matsumoto head of Japan investment at Pictet Asset Management, who cites a lull in the earnings cycle for sluggishness in the markets, with a recovery already priced in and earnings season looming.“There isn’t really a debate that Japan is somehow worse compared to other countries that need to ramp up vaccination because their outbreak is worse,” he said.(Updates with quote in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Vaccine Envy Hits Japan as Pfizer Talks Fail to Lift Markets,2021-04-19 08:54:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaccine-envy-hits-japan-markets-081051989.html

"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market bulls who’ve benefited from moderating U.S. Treasury yields are bracing for a relapse as political risks pile up.MSCI Inc.’s developing-nation stock gauge extended a three-week winning streak on Friday, while a basket of currencies capped its biggest weekly advance since early February. The risk premium on emerging-market sovereign debt also narrowed to 339 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, its lowest since February 2020, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co.Yet the rally is prompting some traders to reassess their bets. Russian shares, which led last week’s equity advance, may come under pressure as the Biden administration evaluates its options to escalate sanctions. South Africa’s rand, the top currency performer in the developing world, is particularly exposed to a potentially stronger dollar, Andres Jaime, a New York-based strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note. There’s also concern that Treasury yields, which have declined for two straight weeks, will revert back to their trend in the first quarter, when U.S. bonds suffered their worst rout since 1980.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it closed its trade recommendation on a basket of developing-nation currencies after the rapid rebound.“Some profit taking on rallies and re-engagement on market wobbles makes sense, even as we keep the faith on cyclical upside over the longer term,” Goldman strategists including Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi wrote in a note Friday. “The idiosyncratic risks that have weighed on EM FX in 2021 are likely to continue to generate volatility and create opportunities.”Listen: EM Weekly Podcast: Easing U.S. Yields; Russia, Indonesia RatesAside from Russia, political risks are gathering pace in Latin America and Asia.

"Gold futures are edging lower on Monday after an early session attempt to take out Friday’s high was met with selling pressure. Treasury yields are dipping lower early in the session, but the U.S. Dollar is trading higher against a basket of currencies, suggesting we could be seeing early signs of a risk off trading session.At 01:30 GMT, June Comex gold futures are trading $1776.60, down $3.60 or -0.20%.Daily Swing Chart Technical AnalysisThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. A trade through $1784.70 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through $1723.20.On the upside, the major resistance is the long-term 50% level at $1788.50.On the downside, the support is a series of 50% levels at $1767.60, $1754.00, $1746.90 and $1731.00. The major support is the long-term 61.8% level at $1711.90.Daily Swing Chart Technical ForecastThe direction of the June Comex gold futures contract on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the long-term 50% level at $1788.50.Bearish ScenarioA sustained move under $1788.50 will indicate the presence of sellers. The first downside target is the 50% level at $1767.60. Since the main trend is up, buyers are likely to come in on the first test of $1767.50. If it fails then look for the selling to possibly extend into a minor 50% level at $1754.00. Once again, buyers could step in to stop the price slide.Bullish ScenarioA sustained move over $1788.50 will signal the presence of buyers. This move could trigger an acceleration to the upside with $1817.60 the next likely upside target price.Side NotesFor bigger picture traders, the retracement zone at $1788.50 to $1711.90 represents 50% to 61.8%, respectively, of last year’s trading range. So overtaking $1788.50 could become a big deal if the buying volume increases on the move. Fundamentally, it’s going to need help from lower yields and a weaker U.S. Dollar. I don’t think gold will be able to sustain a rally over $1788.50 without help from those two factors.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

"(Bloomberg) -- After a historic antitrust crackdown on China’s biggest tech companies last week, investors are betting there is more pain ahead.GAM Investments, BNP Paribas Asset Management and JP Morgan Asset Management Inc. see more regulatory tightening in China’s clampdown on monopolistic practices, putting pressure on the country’s leading internet stocks over the next few months. The Hang Seng Tech Index, where many Chinese tech giants are listed, has already lost about a quarter of its value from a rout that began mid-February.The shockwaves from Beijing’s bid to quell abuses of information and market dominance among industry leaders have left global investors pondering the prospects of China’s internet firms. The antitrust crackdown has exacerbated a global tech selloff sparked by rising bond yields, as traders forecast tighter liquidity conditions at home and abroad and lower company valuations.“Regulations for China internet companies, especially the big ones, will continue to tighten in 2021,” said Marcella Chow, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset. “This uncertainty may act as a cap for some companies temporarily.”China slapped a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. after a four-month long investigation into the e-commerce giant’s market practices, then ordered an overhaul of Ant Group Co. Over the past week, more than 30 tech giants issued pledges to obey antitrust laws after Beijing gave them a month to conduct reviews and comply with government guidelines.READ: Jack Ma’s Double-Whammy Marks the End of China Tech’s Golden AgeAlibaba shares have slumped 23% in Hong Kong from a peak in October. Food delivery platform Meituan and tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which have been on analyst radars for regulatory probes, are down 36% and 18%, respectively, from their peaks earlier this year. By contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index is up more than 8% this year despite entering a technical correction in March.Story continuesLooking ahead, China’s tech companies are likely to move far more cautiously on acquisitions, over-compensate on getting signoffs from Beijing, and levy lower fees on the domestic internet traffic they dominate. This coincides with some facing delisting threats and sales curbs in the U.S., and others reverberating from a selloff sparked by Archegos Capital Management.Valuations too are serving as a deterrent for investors. Even after its decline, the Hang Seng Tech Index is trading at about 38 times its 12-month earnings estimates versus the 29 times multiple of its American counterpart.“We have already applied a valuations discount to the whole Chinese internet sector to factor in higher regulation risks,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a Zurich-based fund manager at GAM. The $132 billion asset manager has reduced its exposure to the sector in the past few months amid high valuations, she added.The Hang Seng Tech Index was down as much as 1.1% on Monday. Tencent shares fell as much as 1.9% after Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley lowered their target prices on expectations that advertising revenues will take a hit as apparel-brand and online-education providers cut spending.Keep the FaithThat said, Beijing has moved far faster with its antitrust reforms than the U.S. and Europe have in similar efforts. The landmark case against Microsoft Corp.’s alleged software monopoly took more than half a decade of back-and-forth before settling in 2004. Current hearings involving U.S. tech titans from Google to Facebook Inc. span several fronts, multiple cases and plaintiffs, and may not see the inside of a courtroom for years to come.In contrast, Beijing regulators torpedoed Ant’s IPO the month after Ma’s infamous speech, published new rules shortly after intended to curb monopolistic practices across its internet landscape, then launched its probe into Alibaba on Christmas Eve.“Clarity reduces uncertainty, so this is a positive,” said Joshua Crabb, a portfolio manager at Robeco in Hong Kong.That has helped give investors more optimism for the long term. Money managers see the potential for tech companies to boost earnings as digital technologies catch on for everything from e-commerce and entertainment to social media, a trend that has been accelerated by the pandemic.Meanwhile, mainland traders have kept the faith. They still hold about 6.5% stake in Tencent, the highest in at least three years, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on exchange data.“Post this round of regulation scrutiny, we believe the Chinese internet industry will resume healthy growth,” GAM’s Cortesi said.(Updates with performance of Hang Seng Tech Index, Tencent in tenth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","China’s Internet Stocks Face More Pain, Global Investors Say",2021-04-19 03:49:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-internet-stocks-face-more-000000083.html

"By Elizabeth HowcroftLONDON (Reuters) - World shares traded near record highs on Monday, as markets were generally upbeat about the prospects for a global economic recovery from COVID-19, ahead of a busy week for earnings.Europe's STOXX 600 reached a record high and was up 0.2% at 0736 GMT. Asian shares hit one-month highs overnight.MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day, having come close to but not surpassed Friday's record high. MSCI's main European Index was up 0.1%.Matthias Scheiber, global head of portfolio management at Wells Fargo Asset Management cited low interest rates, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the fiscal stimulus package in the United States as reasons for his bullish stance on equities.""Risk is coming down, volatility is coming down … we see the slow reopening of global economies, the rollout of the vaccine and the huge catch-up in demand so from that perspective it should be positive for economic growth.""""We had a strong rally in cyclical and value stocks since the start of this year - we would like to see confirmation in the earnings.""Earnings from IBM and Coca-Cola are due later in the session.

Later in the week, American Airlines and Southwest will be the first major post-COVID cyclicals to post results.The European Central Bank meeting on Thursday will also be in focus this week.

"The past year or so has been one of the oddest periods ever for the stock market and economy, with a rare pandemic shutting down businesses and throwing millions of people out of work.At the same time, the federal government stepped up with unprecedented amounts of stimulus payments, free loans to businesses, eviction moratoriums and other aid — even a delayed deadline for filing income-tax returns.Things are off-the-charts unusual. Yet for novice investors who stuck a toe in the stock market for the first time over the past year or so, it's all they know.And it's not just a few people, either. Armed with stimulus checks and motivated by boredom perhaps, millions of people took the stock market plunge last year — a whopping 15% of all current stock investors got their start in 2020, according to a new Schwab survey.Most must be thinking, ""This is easy."" Here are some reasons why they should think twice.Don't expect the next down cycle to be so kind.Not a joke anymore: Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency created as a spoof, sees its market value top $40BThe stock market has climbed steadily for the past 13 months, over which time it has nearly doubled in value. That's rare in itself. But the really unusual part was the extremely short duration of the preceding bear market or downward spiral, which lasted just five weeks.No wonder these first-year investors are more optimistic about near- and long-term results compared to more seasoned market participants, according to the Schwab survey. The newbies also tend to be younger — 35 years old, on average, compared to 48 for people who started investing prior to 2020. They thus can afford to be more optimistic, as they have more time to make up losses.It's true that rising or bull markets always spring from the ashes of bear markets, but usually those preceding downdrafts are much more prolonged. That's the real challenge of investing — dealing with month after month, if not year after year, of falling prices, when disappointment leads to despair and then desperation.Story continuesIf you blinked, you missed the bearish phase of 2020. The next downward cycle won't be so kind.FedEx says no phones allowed?: FedEx workers at Indianapolis shooting weren't allowed to have their phones: Is that OK?Should you ever get a store card? Yes: Store cards are a bad deal. Here's why I opened one anyway.Don't count on so much free moneyInvesting, like gambling, isn't so difficult when you're playing with house money. That was somewhat the case for millions of Americans who received stimulus payments from Uncle Sam or possibly souped-up unemployment benefits.Sure, plenty of people used this cash as financial lifelines, to stay afloat. But others saved their stimulus checks or put them to use in the stock market.In other words, some new investors probably don't fully appreciate that investing involves sacrifice: You forego consumption today in hopes that your money will grow enough over time that higher spending will be possible years down the road.Stimulus checks don't arrive every year, though there is one form of free money that you can tap into on an ongoing basis. These are the matching funds available through workplace 401(k)-style funds that employers ante up to encourage workers to invest.Even the federal government offers limited retired matching funds to lower-income workers, through the widely underappreciated Retirement Savers tax credit (details at irs.gov). It's not a huge sum — a maximum credit of $1,000 annually to the lowest-income workers — but it beats the stimulus money you can count on most years.Don't assume your buddies are rightThere's a lot of psychology to investing, and one tendency is that people seek out confirming views from friends, family members and colleagues. There's something heartening about having your investing ideas validated by others. The danger is that these other parties might have even less knowledge than you.More than in most years, collaborative investing appears to be on the rise. For example, a survey by MagnifyMoney, a subsidiary of Lending Tree, found that nearly six in 10 investors age 40 or younger are members of online forums such as Reddit. These can be good ways to learn about finances, but they also might lead you astray.""It's great that these communities are introducing a lot of people to investing, which is one of the best ways to build wealth over a lifetime,” said Tendayi Kapfidze, LendingTree's chief economist, in a statement. “A concern is that some are leading to relatively short-term trading concentrated in a few stocks with hopes of getting rich quick.”Usually, investors are better off thinking for themselves and tuning out the ""noise"" or outside distractions. In part, this is because other people often have different goals, tolerance for risk or other motivations compared to you. Or, they're just wrong.Don't neglect your financial foundationStock market investing is important — and one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. But it shouldn't come at the expense of other financial needs.Setting up a rainy day fund is one example. It seems simple enough — accumulate money in a savings account to meet emergency car or appliance repairs or to tide you over if you lose your job. Yet many Americans have no personal safety nets — 43% of respondents in a recent study by Clever Real Estate said they have nothing.Dana Sandoval, a certified financial planner at TCI Wealth Advisors in Denver who educates young adults in the nonprofit 3rd Decade program, suggests that everyone set up an emergency fund and take other fundamental steps. These include participating in workplace 401(k) plans if available and gravitating toward Roth Individual Retirement Accounts, which allow for tax-free withdrawals down the road.Understanding the tax implications is important, as stock market profits might be taxed as ordinary income, at lower capital-gain rates or as untaxed withdrawals, depending on the type of account and how long you own an investment.And rather than concentrate your money in a handful of stocks, Sandoval recommends spreading it out through low-cost, diversified mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. The market's strong performance last year, she noted, was driven by a smattering of large, technology-focused companies including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.But already, there are signs that the market's leadership is shifting.Besides, pinpointing future hot stocks isn't easy to do, except in hindsight.""Saving more and controlling expenses will have a more predictable positive impact,"" she said.This article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Stock market: New investors should know what's next for stocks",New investors beware: The easy money you made in the stock market probably won't continue,2021-04-19 01:28:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-beware-easy-money-made-151339774.html
"(Bloomberg) -- Credit markets are starting to price in the transition to a low carbon economy.New research from Oxford University that analyzes changes in loan spreads -- a measure of credit risk -- found the cost of financing renewable energy projects shrunk dramatically over the past two decades, while the opposite was true for coal, the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.When comparing average spreads from 2007 to 2010 with those from 2017 to 2020, the researchers recorded a 12% decline for onshore wind and 24% drop for offshore wind farms. By contrast, coal power stations saw a 38% increase in loan spreads and coal mines recorded a 54% jump.“Climate-related transition risks in the energy sector are sometimes viewed as distant, long-term risks,” said Ben Caldecott, co-author of the report and director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme. “Our findings support the conclusion that they are being priced today.”To have any chance of reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, all sectors of the economy will have to cut emissions and retool their operations for a net-zero world. Achieving that monumental feat will require about $2.4 trillion of investment in the energy sector every year and for lenders and debt underwriters to support the transition away from fossil fuels.And while the pivot to a low-carbon world is already having an impact on the cost of capital for energy companies, “the challenge is that this isn’t happening evenly and certainly isn’t occurring at the pace required to tackle climate change,” Caldecott said. One area where financing costs will need to rise, is for oil and gas projects, he said.While loan spreads for gas-fired power stations rose by 68% from 2000 to 2010, they rose by just 7% in the past decade, the Oxford data show. Meanwhile, financing costs for oil and gas production, were stable during the past decade, with loan spreads rising by only 3%. For offshore oil, spreads contracted by 41% in the period.Story continuesThe data suggest that oil and gas companies have evaded the same degree of financial punishment that’s occurred in the coal sector. That’s likely to change, according to Xiaoyan Zhou, lead author of the Oxford study.“If these observed trends continue and we see the cost of capital for oil and gas go the way of coal, this could have very significant implications for the economics of oil and gas projects around the world,” Zhou said. “This could result in stranded assets and introduce substantial re-financing risks.”The Oxford analysis is based on 12,072 loans between 2000 and 2020 from 5,033 borrowers across 118 countries in the energy and utilities sectors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Loan Markets Are Pricing In Climate Transition, Penalizing Coal",2021-04-19 00:01:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loan-markets-pricing-climate-transition-230100343.html
"It’s natural to want to buy into a rising stock, so much so that following upward trends as a market strategy has a name: momentum investing. It’s the art of following the upward trends.Momentum investing has its advocates and detractors, as do all investing styles. While past performance does not guarantee future returns, it's still a a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.With this in mind, we used TipRanks' database to identify two stocks that boast a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and considerable upside potential – on top of impressive recent gains. Let's take a closer look.Identiv (INVE)The first momentum stock we’ll look at, Identiv, is a tech company providing solutions for authentication and security systems online. Identiv’s products protect users’ identity, and prevent malware and other malicious attacks in the IoT world. The importance – and value – of this niche can be seen in the company’s share growth over the past year. INVE is up 65% year-to-date, and longer term, over the past 12 months, the stock has gained 404%.The strong share growth has gone hand-in-hand with strong revenue growth. The company reported 31% year-over-year top-line growth, to $24.8 million, in 4Q20, along with solid prospects going forward. Entering Q1, the company had $10.5 million in backlogged orders, a 121% gain over the year before. Growth was driven by gains in the company’s RFID segment, which was up over 100% yoy, and in the Identity segment, which registered a 53% yoy gain.While revenues were solid, earnings were down. EPS had been positive in Q3, but turned negative in Q4, coming in at a 5-cent net loss per share, and missing the expectation of a 1-cent EPS profit. Investors have not appeared too concerned by the earnings loss; Identiv’s historical earnings pattern is to show a Q4 loss after a Q3 profit, and the 4Q20 loss was 7 cents per share less than the year-ago result.Management has moved to take advantage of the company’s rising share value, by putting a public offering of stock earlier this month. The offering, of 3.78 million shares at $10.65 each, closed on April 12 and raised – before expenses – over $40 million.Story continuesThere’s a lot here to get an analyst’s attention, and 5-star analyst Craig Ellis of B. Riley initiated coverage of this stock with a Buy rating and a $21 price target, indicating ~50% one-year upside potential. (To view Ellis’s track record, click here)""We believe the recent capital raise is transformative and will accelerate growth from 10% over the past two years to +20% as the company broadens its RFID IoT portfolio. To start, $38M in net proceeds suggests $50M in incremental sales potential at current GMs,"" Ellis opined.The analyst added, ""We believe that INVE’s custom engagement, design, and prototype model is strong and that CY22 proceeds sales conversion is likely, led by RFID IoT, where 3Q20 and 4Q20 sales surged 100% Y/Y and where CY21TD backlog is robust. Success with healthcare, consumer electronics, and medical devices early adopters could tilt high-volume industries INVE’s way, thus enriching growth.""Ellis is not outlier in his view of this stock; there are 3 recent reviews on file here, and all are to buy, making the analyst consensus a unanimous Strong Buy. The shares are priced at $14.04, with an average target of $17.33 suggesting room for 23% growth in the year ahead. (See INVE stock analysis on TipRanks)Tronox (TROX)Next up, Tronox, is a miner and manufacturer of specialty metals used in the production of titanium chemicals. The company mines titanium ores and zircon, and uses them in the production of titanium dioxide and chemical sands, both essential ingredients in industrial dyes. The company’s products are found in a range of everyday products, including paints, papers, and plastics, and useful byproducts of the manufacturing process include caustic soda and gypsum.While the industry lacks the cachet of high-tech, it is still vital to the modern economy, and Tronox has ridden that fact to a 37% year-to-date share gain. For the past 12 months, the stock’s gain has been 224%.For the full-year 2020, Tronox showed a top line of $2.76 billion, up 4.5% from 2019. The 4Q20 results show that the top line gains are accelerating – the fourth quarter revenues of $783 million were up 13.6% yoy. The company saw quarterly titanium dioxide sales volume increase 8% yoy in the fourth quarter, indicating improved global demand as world economies reopen. Looking ahead, Tronox expects titanium dioxide sales to continue gaining, in the range of 11% to 15% for 1Q21.With all of that in the background, BMO analyst John McNulty listed TROX as one of his top picks for 2021“Rarely can we recall a time when the stars aligned in such a way that the risk/reward pointed to dramatic upside potential with relatively minimal risk--the current outlook for TiO2 and TROX is one of those times. TiO2 is poised for a steady tightening over the next 2-3 years, driving volumes and prices higher,” McNulty noted.The analyst summed up, ""We listed TROX as one of our top picks for 2021 for a host of reasons, including our belief that the strength of the cycle would surprise investors in the near term on the volume side and in the intermediate term on the pricing side.""In line with this upbeat outlook, McNulty rates TROX shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $29 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 45%. (To watch McNulty’s track record, click here)The analyst consensus on this stock is not unanimous – but it is decisive. The reviews break down 4 to 1 in favor of Buy versus Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $24.40 suggests a 22% upside for the next 12 months.

"June E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index futures finished slightly higher on Friday. The index hit a new record high during the session, but it was a struggle with tech behemoths Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Tesla Inc and Microsoft Corp, slipping between 0.2% and 1.5%. In the cash market, the technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite finished less than one percent below its own all-time closing high achieved on February 12.On Friday, June E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index futures settled at 14029.50, up 15.50 or +0.11%.The Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low despite inflation has also revived demand for richly valued technology stocks, although bond yields edged higher again on Friday after hitting multi-week lows a day earlier.Daily June E-mini NASDAQ-100 IndexDaily Swing Chart Technical AnalysisThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The uptrend was reaffirmed on Friday when buyers took out Thursday’s high at 14034.25.A trade through 12609.75 will change the main trend to down. This is highly unlikely, but due to the prolonged move up in terms of price and time, the index closed on Friday inside the window of time for a potentially bearish closing price reversal top.The minor trend is also up. A trade through 13512.50 will change the minor trend to down. This will also shift momentum to the downside.The minor range is 13512.50 to 14059.50. Its 50% level at 13786.00 is the nearest support.The main range is 12609.75 to 14059.50. If the minor trend changes to down then look for the selling to possibly extend into its retracement zone at 13334.50 to 13165.50.Short-Term OutlookThe uptrend is very strong and it’s going to take some time to change the main trend to down. However, a higher-high, lower-close will be the first sign of selling pressure. The formation of a closing price reversal top chart pattern will give investors an early warning to start trimming long positions.Some aggressive traders will choose to use this chart pattern as a shorting opportunity. This will be much better than trying to pick a top. However, keep in mind that a closing price reversal top does not change the trend. It only indicates the selling is greater than the buying at current price levels.Story continuesThe daily chart currently indicates that a combination of a closing price reversal top and a sustained move under 13786.00 could trigger the start of a steep break with 13334.50 the minimum objective.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) made new highs last week of $417.91 and $64,896.75, respectively, while small and midcap stocks trading on smaller exchanges took a pause.Although Bitcoin has consolidated over the weekend, indicating the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and the Nasdaq may need some consolidation in the coming days, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) and Biomark Diagnostics Inc. (OTC: BMKDF) look bullish going into the week.Related Link: Bitcoin Plunges, Taking Other Cryptocurrencies With ItThe Ethereum Chart: Ethereum made a new all-time high of $2548.53 April 15 and has since consolidated.On Sunday, Ethereum retraced to a daily support level at $1935.44 and bounced sharply, regaining a higher daily support level at $2,150, which aligns with the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA).Although Ethereum is trading below the eight-day EMA, the eight-day EMA is still trending above the 21-day EMA, making for an overall bullish picture.Bulls want to see Ethereum continue to hold the $2,500 support level and the 21-day EMA. They also want see it consolidate healthily near all-time highs while it collects enough volume to push it back towards all-time highs.Bears want to see sustained bear volume to push Ethereum back down below its $2,500 support level. If Ethereum can’t hold that support level, it could retest the $1,935 mark and eventually force the eight-day EMA to cross below the 21-day EMA. If that happens, it could push Ethereum down further towards the $1,824 area.eth_april_18.pngThe Snowflake Chart: Snowflake has retraced 45% from its all-time high of $429 made on Dec. 8, 2020. The stock has fallen into a bullish falling wedge pattern, however, and on April 13 made a bullish break up from it.Snowflake’s stock is trading on both the eight-day and 21-day EMAs and bullish volume, with even a slight move up in share price, would cause the eight-day EMA to cross above the 21-day EMA, which would be bullish. Declining bear volume on the daily chart shows the stock is running out of sellers, which is also a bullish sign.Story continuesLearn more: Technical AnalysisBulls want to see bull volume come into Snowflake’s stock and for it to push off the $232.74 support it is trading at to make a move towards its next resistance level at $255.25. If the stock can reclaim that level, it could move towards the $270 mark.Bears want to see Snowflake’s stock lose support at the $232 area, which could see it fall down to the stock’s next level of support around $213.snow_april_18.pngThe Biomark Chart: After reaching an all-time high of 42 cents on March 17, Biomark’s stock settled into two bullish patters — a daily bull flag and a daily symmetrical triangle — before breaking bullish on Friday and making a new all-time high on large bull volume.Biomark’s stock is trading above both the eight- and 21-day EMA, which is a bullish sign, and, although somewhat extended from them, the two commonly followed EMAs made an abrupt upward turn on Friday to try and catch up.Bulls want to see sustained bullish volume in Biomark’s stock for it to continue its run in all-time highs as there is no price history resistance. Bulls could wait for a retest of the previous all-time high of 42 cents to see if the stock holds above.Bears want to see bull volume drop off and for Biomark’s stock to lose support at the 42-cent level, which could see the stock drop back down to 35 cents. If Biomark can’t hold support there, it has room to drop further towards the 32-cent area.bmkdf_april_18.pngRelated Link: 3 Cancer Diagnostic Stocks To Watch Following Roche's GenMark BuyETH, SNOW and BMKDF Price Action: Etherium was trading at $2170.05 at publication.

"Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. (DFIN), industry leader in risk and compliance solutions, provides regulatory and compliance services for both private and public corporations. The company is the largest SEC filer in the United States with 2020 submissions of more than 80,000. In addition, it is the second largest SEC compliance software provider trailing Workiva Inc. (WK).Despite being a dominant player in these fields, Donnelley Financial has seen its revenue decline for several years, ever since it was spun off from R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) in 2016.The drop in revenue is partially attributable to the secular decline of the company's print business due to regulatory changes and the convenience of software-based solutions. The rest is associated with the elimination of non-strategic business assets and competition for regularized SEC filings as customers transition to software-based filing applications. Workiva has been grabbing market share from Donnelley Financial for several years with its software-based solutions.Business Transformation2020 appears to have been the turning point as Donnelley Financial progresses through its own digital transformation. Total organic revenue growth increased by 2.3% in FY'20 and expectations are for low single-digit growth in the coming year.The company has been moving away from print media and shifting towards Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), with applications such as ActiveDisclosure and Venue Virtual Data Room, two products that provide regularized and transactional filings, respectively.While “high-growth” won't be in management's vocabulary any time soon, investors can take comfort in the fact that the revenue mix is shifting towards software and tech-enabled solutions, resulting in a higher level of profitability and free cash flow. Donnelley Financial is in the process of completing its plan to minimize its manufacturing footprint, which will significantly reduce fixed costs, increase profitability, and allow for double-digit recurring revenue growth in the long run.Story continuesBusiness Segment TrendsCurrently, Software Solutions and Tech-Enabled Services account for 26% and 51% of net sales, respectively, while Print and Distribution generate 23% of sales.Q4'20 year-over-year revenue decreased by 12.9% for Print and Distribution, whereas revenue for Tech-Enabled Services increased by 27.6% and Software Solutions by 8%.Looking ahead, the company is calling for Software Solutions revenue growth of 10% annually, while Print and Distribution sales are expected to shrink. Tech-Enabled Services, consisting of SEC transactional and compliance filings, delivered strong growth in Q4'20 due to increasing market share and a strong uptick in IPO and M&A activity, which is set to continue in the year ahead. The company anticipates that by 2024, the revenue mix will be 44% for Software Solutions, 40% for Tech-Enabled Services, and 16% for Print and Distribution.Stock ChartDFIN's digital transformation has not gone unnoticed by the investment community, given that the share price is up 391.6% in the last year.That said, even with the strong stock performance, there is still fuel left in the tank. Donnelley Financial has a low valuation with a price/sales ratio of only 1.11, far less than the industry average of 12.3.Wall Street’s TakeFrom Wall Street analysts, Donnelley Financial Solutions earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 2 Buys. Additionally, the average analyst price target of $31.50 puts the upside potential at 7.5%. (See Donnelley Financial Solutions stock analysis on TipRanks)Summary And ConclusionsDonnelley Financial is the industry leader in risk and compliance solutions, assisting companies with global security regulations. However, being at the top of the food chain doesn't guarantee success. In fact, DFIN's revenue decline in recent years reflects the secular decline in the company's Print and Distribution business.Having said that, the company is undergoing a digital transformation, scaling down Print and Distribution while introducing SaaS solutions for SEC filing and other regulatory applications. Revenue growth was slightly positive in 2020, with hints of the strong growth and profitability to come in the next few years. Therefore, despite the impressive share price rise over the last year, DFIN is still undervalued.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Steve Auger did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

"June E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rallied on Friday, setting another record in the process amid strong earnings from blue-chip companies especially the bank stocks, which continued to rise on bumper quarterly earnings reports.Morgan Stanley reported a 150% jump in quarterly profit on Friday, helping to boost the performance of Dow components JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group as investors continued to bet on a swift economic recovery.On Friday, June E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures settled at 34081, up 158 or +0.46%.In other news, the University of Michigan said Friday its preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to a one-year high of 86.5 in the first half of this month form 84.9 in March. Additionally, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday the U.S. economy is set to take off, but there’s still no reason to start tightening policy.Daily June E-mini Dow Jones Industrial AverageDaily Swing Chart Technical AnalysisThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The uptrend was reaffirmed on Friday when buyers took out the previous high at 33862. A trade through 34144 on Monday will signal a resumption of the uptrend.A trade through 31951 will change the main trend to down. This is highly unlikely but due to the prolonged move up in terms of price and time, the Dow is ripe for a closing price reversal top.We’re not going to guess when the pattern will form. We’re not going to sell a new high and hope for a lower close. We’re likely to let it form first then wait for the confirmation. The uptrend is strong so it doesn’t make sense to try to guess until we start to see evidence of sellers.We do suspect, however, that the top won’t be formed by economic data, but rather a surprise event. Something has to happen that will create enough uncertainty to encourage the longs to start trimming positions.Short-Term OutlookA higher-high, lower-close will be the best sign that the selling is greater than the buying at current price levels. The next best sign will be a lower-low, which will make 34144 a new minor top.Story continuesA third sign of a top will be the failure to hold the minor 50% level at 33651.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

"June E-mini S&P 500 Index futures closed higher on Friday with the benchmark index breaking another record close. The strength was driven by strong economic data and bank earnings which served as signs of momentum in the U.S. pandemic recovery.On Friday, June E-mini S&P 500 Index futures settled at 4176.25, up 13.75 or +0.33%.Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors rose on Friday.

The uptrend was reaffirmed on Friday when buyers took out the previous high at 4166.50.A trade through 3843.25 will change the main trend to down. This is highly unlikely, but since the index is up 15 days from its last main bottom, it closed Friday’s session inside the window of time for a closing price reversal top.The minor trend is also up. A trade through 4101.5 will change the minor trend to down. This will also shift momentum to the downside.The minor range is 4101.25 to 4183.50. Its 50% level at 4142.25 is potential support.The main range is 3843.25 to 4183.50. If the minor trend changes to down then this will open up the possibility of a further decline into its retracement zone at 4013.25 to 3973.25.Short-Term OutlookThere is no resistance so it’s important to watch for a few patterns that could signal a short-term top.Taking out Friday’s low at 4154.25 will make 4183.50 a new minor top. This will be a sign that the selling may be greater than the selling at current price levels.Taking out 4183.50 then closing lower for the session will form a closing price reversal top. If confirmed then this could trigger the start of a 2 to 3 day correction.Story continuesIt doesn’t make sense to try to pick a top. When you try to short, you’re only feeding the bull.If this market is going to form a short-term top, it’s not likely to be related to an economic event, but rather surprise news.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

"Investors who have owned stocks in the last year have generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 47.3%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way.Cronos’ Disappointing Road: One company that has been a lackluster investment in the last year has been Canadian cannabis producer Cronos Group Inc (NASDAQ: CRON).Cronos battled a difficult Canadian cannabis market throughout 2020. In February, the company reported an impressive 133% sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA losses in the company’s international business narrowed, while U.S. losses widened.Cronos also recently announced that it could launch lab-grown cannabis by the end of 2021. Assuming the quality is comparable to the existing product, lab-grown cannabis could potentially significantly reduce production costs for Cronos, helping improve the company’s bottom line. Cronos reported a $73 million net loss in 2020.Cronos has the financial backing of tobacco giant Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO), which owns nearly 50% of Cronos. Altria’s support has allowed Cronos to operate with one of the strongest balance sheets in the cannabis space.Learn more: How To Invest In Cannabis StocksHowever, Cronos shares are also priced at a steep premium to many of its Canadian peers at more than 63 times sales.At the beginning of 2020, Cronos shares were trading at around $7.90. By the beginning of March, the stock was down to $5.89 after news of COVID-19 spreading in China prompted concerns about a U.S. pandemic.Cronos bottomed at $4 during the pandemic-driven March sell-off. Fortunately for Cronos investors, the sell-off didn’t last long.By June, Cronos shares made it back up to $8/13, but the rally stalled at that point until the November U.S. presidential election.Related Link: If You Invested ,000 In Tilray Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now The victory of Joe Biden, a Democrat, and a surprise blue wave gave the party control of both the Senate and House, sending cannabis stocks soaring on optimism that U.S. cannabis legalization may be just around the corner.Story continuesCronos In 2021, Beyond: The stock ultimately peaked at $15.83 in February 2021 during a retail investor-fueled short squeeze before pulling back to around $8.25. Traders may be taking profits on Cronos’ big post-election run. Or they may simply see a lack of progress on U.S. legalization and more lackluster growth numbers from the Canadian market as reasons to be skeptical of the stock in the near term.Cronos investors who bought one year ago and held on through the volatility have still made a decent return. In fact, $1,000 in Cronos stock bought on April 14, 2020, would be worth about $1,378 today.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting only modest gains for Cronos in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 10 analysts covering the stock is $8.45, suggesting 12.7% upside from current levels.(Photo by Esteban Lopez on Unsplash)See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaIf You Invested ,000 In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin And Other Cryptos 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now'Four Horsemen' Driving The Retail Trading Euphoria: SPACs, Stonks, Cryptos And NFTs© 2021 Benzinga.com.

"It was a week full of strong reports to kick off earnings season, as well as encouraging economic data to kick off an economic boom. As a result, each of the major indices gained 1% or more over the five days with two of them sustaining a record-setting pace and the third on the doorstep of its own milestone.  The Dow kept pushing past 34K on Friday with a gain of 0.48% (or about 164 points) to 34,200.67. The S&P rose 0.36% to 4185.47. Both of these indices hit new record closes (just as they did yesterday) and rose by 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, for the week.  After moving 1% or more in each of the previous three sessions, the NASDAQ only advanced 0.10% (or around 13 points) to 14,052.34. But its now only 0.3% from its own closing high set all the way back in mid-February. The index rose 1% this week.  Strong bank earnings continued today with Morgan Stanley (MS) and PNC Financial (PNC) beating by 29% and 49%, respectively.  The past three days have laid the foundation for a strong season with solid performances from JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) as well… even if the market didn’t always reward the positive results. These banks have been releasing billions of dollars in loan loss reserves that were put aside during the pandemic.  “In effect, these banks are saying, through these reserve releases, that they expect economic conditions in the coming quarters to be stronger relative to what they had originally modeled. This creates a favorable read-through for all sectors, particularly the economically-sensitive ones,” said Zacks’ Director of Research Sheraz Mian in his new article titled: Big Banks Foreshadow the Improving 2021 Earnings Picture.  Meanwhile, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to 86.5 in the first half of April, which is a one-year high. This data comes a day after reports of retail sales soaring 9.8% in March and jobless claims of only 576K for last week. Both of those results easily surpassed expectations and provide further optimism that we’re moving past the pandemic.  Earnings season picks up steam next week with more than 250 companies reporting, including the first FAANG as Netflix (NFLX) takes centerstage on Tuesday.  Today's Portfolio Highlights:  Surprise Trader: With earnings season underway and this portfolio getting a whole lot busier, Dave wants to shed the older names to make room for new additions. Therefore, he took a “victory lap” on Friday by selling homebuilder Lennar (LEN) for a more than 20% return in a little over a month. The new buy is Tractor Supply (TSCO), the largest farm and ranch chain in the country. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for four straight quarters now, and the editor expects more of the same when it goes to the plate again before the bell on Thursday, April 22. It has a positive Earnings ESP of 4.5%. Dave added TSCO today with a 12.5% allocation. Make sure to see the complete commentary for more on today’s action.  Options Trader: This portfolio has repositioned into new options a couple times this week, so let’s do it one more time before the weekend! As you know, Kevin likes to pull profits on options that have doubled the premium and then add a new one with more time at the original dollar amount. He calls it a “free trade”. And that’s what he did on Friday with Nasdaq (NDAQ). The editor sold to close the June 145.00 Call for a 117% return and then bought to open a September 165.00 Call. Therefore, the principal is protected and the position can continue making money. See the full write-up for more.  Blockchain Innovators: You were promised an addition for Friday... and here it is! The portfolio added Sohu.com (SOHU), an online advertising, media and gaming services company. A unit of SOHU has set up a blockchain research institute called Fox Fintech, which uses the technology to reduce credit costs in the financial sector and promote the growth of peer-to-peer lending. Rising earnings estimates have made the company a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, Dave also sold the underperforming Digi International (DGII) position after it slipped to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Read the full write-up for more on today’s moves. In other news, this portfolio had a top performer on Friday as iClick Interactive Asia Group (ICLK) rose 7.5%.  Healthcare Innovators: Last Friday, Kevin re-bought vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) after pulling a more than 40% profit out of this name in March. He said that a lot of the company’s positives weren't being reflected in its share price, which was opening up an opportunity. Well, on this Friday NVAX was the top performer among all ZU names with a gain of 12.5%. In fact, all of the portfolio’s vaccine names did well this week, giving Moderna (MRNA) a spot in the top 5 as well with an advance of 6.8%. A vaccine shortage in a few countries around the globe will keep demand for these treatments very high as we put the pandemic in the rear-view mirror. One more thing, NVAX is also the top performer over the past 30 days in Kevin’s other portfolio, TAZR Trader. It’s up 26.5% in that time.  Have a Great Weekend!

"(Bloomberg) -- Investors’ love affair with technology stocks has cooled off noticeably this year.And while the upcoming deluge of earnings from the group may offer an opportunity to rekindle the romance, tech faces an uphill battle in commanding the type of devotion it once enjoyed in the stock market.After trouncing all other sectors in 2020, tech stocks in the S&P 500 Index have drifted toward the back of the pack this year, out-performed by sectors like financials and industrials perceived to have better growth prospects. Bulls are betting that strong results and forecasts from companies like Apple Inc. will help catapult tech back to the forefront, yet lofty valuations pose a challenge.“If these companies want to return to share-price growth, they need to have a good story about where growth is going to come from and when,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.A rally in the past two weeks has returned the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index to a record this month after rising interest rates and concerns the stocks were too expensive sent the benchmark down 11% in early March. While tech is once again leading the market for the month of April, an advance of 9.9% for the group in the S&P 500 this year still trails seven of the 11 other main industries.As is usually the case, the tech group is expected to post strong growth in sales and earnings. What’s different this time is that growth in much of the rest of the market will be even better this year, flattered by comparisons to the same period in 2020 when broad swathes of the economy were shut down.Technology companies are expected to lead the S&P 500 with 16% revenue growth in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Projections for the rest of the year, however, aren’t quite as bright. Growth is expected to be just 5.6% in the fourth quarter. In terms of profit expansion, tech looks even less appealing with estimates for 2021 at 22% — an impressive performance, to be sure, but one that would lag behind financials, industrials, consumer discretionary and materials.Story continuesFor the bears, even beating those growth projections isn’t enough to support valuations that are the highest in years. At 41 times trailing profits, the Nasdaq 100 is trading at the most-expensive valuation since 2004.Investors who are fretting about valuations are underestimating revenue growth potential for many technology companies like Microsoft Corp. and cybersecurity company Zscaler Inc. that are poised to capture even more spending from companies investing in digital services, according to Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc.“What’s been lost in the noise is the massive underlying fundamental growth stories that are happening as part of the digital transformation,” said Ives. “Across the board, it’s going to be a domination quarter for the tech space.”Trailing the S&PAmazon.com Inc. is the only company among the top five projected to see its revenue growth shrink this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s hardly a surprise considering how much its core businesses like e-commerce and web services surged in 2020 as a result of U.S. lockdowns.Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple and Microsoft are all expected to see revenue growth accelerate in their current fiscal years.Amazon and Apple, the two best performing megacap stocks last year, have trailed the S&P 500 in 2021. Amazon has gained 4.4%, while Apple has advanced just 1.1%.Some of the most-expensive software companies, in particular, have taken a beating so far this year. Coupa Software Inc., a maker of expense management software that trades at nearly 30 times this year’s projected sales, has fallen more than 20%.For some investors, elevated valuations are not ignored so easily.“Tech stocks are extremely expensive historically,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “Even if the optimistic earnings forecasts are met, the market would still be very expensive.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Tech Stocks Are Mired in Unfamiliar Territory as Market Laggards,2021-04-17 14:00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-stocks-mired-unfamiliar-territory-120039304.html

"China's job market has improved steadily since the height of the coronavirus pandemic early in 2020, but it is still struggling with a shortage of labour and a high number of unemployed graduates.In the first quarter of the year, China's official surveyed unemployment rate stood at 5.4 per cent, down 0.4 percentage points from a year earlier when the outbreak first began, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""This shows that young people still face difficulties in employment. It could be because a large number of young people are trying to enter the labour market after the Lunar New Year,"" NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua said on Friday.""It will take some time to resolve the employment problem of young people, and the pressure does exist.""Typically spring and autumn are peak seasons for graduates looking for jobs. This year, a record high of 9.09 million people will finish tertiary studies, compared to 8.74 million last year.Meanwhile, China's big industrial firms are also having problems finding enough workers, from frontline staff to technical experts. A recent NBS survey of more than 90,000 firms in economically thriving provinces showed a record 44 per cent of them were most concerned with hiring difficulties.""Some in the service sector, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, still face production and operation difficulties and are still recovering. This affects employment demand and indirectly causes the number of migrant workers to not yet be back to the pre-Covid level,"" Liu said.While the number of jobs available had nearly risen to the same level as the first five weeks after the Lunar New Year in 2019, small companies with fewer than 100 employees still hired 10 per cent less than 2019, according to data from Zhaopin, a large job portal in China.Story continuesAccording to Zhaopin data, the industries that hired most after Lunar New Year this year included real estate agencies and logistics services, whose job posts expanded 1.9 times and 1.4 times respectively, compared to the same period in 2019.Many offline industries were still recovering slowly from the pandemic, including tourism, where hiring demand was still only half the 2019 level.Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of new job posts from state-owned enterprises, joint ventures and foreign wholly-owned firms all fell in the first quarter, despite more job applicants, according to the China Institute for Employment Research, which analyzed quarterly job data compiled by Zhaopin.On a year-on-year basis, hiring demand among the three types of firms also declined faster than job seekers.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
