yahoo finance news data collection using selenium and bs4
In data collection using bs4 and selenium article [a link](https://zzhu17.medium.com/web-scraping-yahoo-finance-news-a18f9b20ee8a), gathering article's urls is done in a for loop and defining webdriver several times. we have used another approch: Scrolling down a page to find an element by XPATH, we could gather 50 links.
Ofcourse we do not claim that it's the best soultion but if you suggest any netter solution, please share it with us.
