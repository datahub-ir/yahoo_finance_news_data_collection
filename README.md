yahoo finance news data collection via selenium and bs4

In [data collection via bs4 and selenium article](https://zzhu17.medium.com/web-scraping-yahoo-finance-news-a18f9b20ee8a), gathering article's urls is done using a for loop and defining webdriver several times. we have used another approch: Scrolling down a page to find an element by XPATH.Therfore we could gather 50 links.

Ofcourse we do not claim that it's the best approach but if you suggest any better solution, please share it with us.
